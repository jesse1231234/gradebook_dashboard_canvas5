# Canvas Gradebook + Echo Analyzer — Script-Accurate (Light Theme)

This Streamlit app mirrors the analysis performed by your two Python scripts:
- **Gradebook Formatting 15 GOOD.py** — gradebook CSVs
- **Echo Formatting 5.py** — Echo engagement CSVs

Upload your CSVs and download Excel outputs that replicate the scripts (formulas, tables, charts/formatting where applicable).

## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Samples
- `samples/sample_grades.csv`
- `samples/sample_echo.csv`
